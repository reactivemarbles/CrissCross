/// Defines a flexible grid area that arranges child elements in rows and columns.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>The Grid control enables complex layouts by allowing child elements to be positioned in specific rows
/// and columns, with support for row and column spanning. It is commonly used for form layouts, dashboards, and other
/// scenarios requiring precise alignment of multiple elements. The number and sizing of rows and columns can be
/// customized using RowDefinitions and ColumnDefinitions. By default, child elements are placed in the first row and
/// column unless otherwise specified.</remarks>
